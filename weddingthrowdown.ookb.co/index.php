                        <p>
                            We’re getting married and hope you can join us to celebrate.  We’ve planned a weekend in Chicago, the city where Chris was born and raised and where our relationship was conceived and spent its nascent years.  In lieu of traditional wedding trappings, we hope to celebrate by sharing our favorite things with our favorite people.   That means no ceremony, no cake cutting, and no garter toss.  That does not mean, however, Meredith will forgo her long-held childhood fantasy of parading around in a white dress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After weeding out espousing the benefits of bodybuilding (Chris) and breastfeeding (Meredith) from our list, we were able to agree on a few favorite things – spending time with family and friends (you), indulging in food and beverage, and “throwing down” to good music.  With these imperatives in mind, we’ve planned a weekend of parties for October 17th and 18th, 2008.  We’ll be hosting three events, and you’re invited to attend as many or as few as you’d like.
                        </p>
