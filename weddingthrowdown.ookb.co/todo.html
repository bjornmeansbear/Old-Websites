	                        As anyone who is on our invite list knows, we really like to eat. This fact was reinforced when we sat down to compile our short list of favorite restaurants which, even after fierce editing, is still seventeen establishments long. Even if you’re eating champs like us, it is unlikely that you will experience all of these places in one weekend, but we hope our recommendations will help make each meal you chose in Chicago an enjoyable one.

                                        Victory’s Banner is far and away our favorite brunch spot.  Run by Sri Chinmoy devotees (yes, we did study meditation with them), the food is vegetarian and delicious.  We always split the eggless wonder #2 and the insanely thick French toast.  The drinkaholic recommends the iced chai.

                                        Silver Cloud has the best grilled cheese on the planet.  Order a side of tater tots, and the restaurant really fulfils its motto:  food like mom would make, if she were gettin’ paid.   Of course, only one of our mothers fully recognized the culinary genius of tater tots.

                                        Blind Faith is yet another vegetarian restaurant on our favorites roster.  Worth the trip to Evanston. Chris likes the enchiladas verde and Meredith always requests the peanut butter blondie with the most peanut butter.

A new branch has recently opened, but for the full kitsch experience, go to the Western Ave location.  You will be served ice cream sundaes in giant plastic seashells and surrounded by knick-knack heavy décor.  If you got all A’s on your report card, you can get a free sundae!

                                        Potbelly Sandwich Works has expanded in recent years, virtually taking over the Loop and even opening a branch in Meredith’s parent’s haunts in Ann Arbor, MI.  Chris fondly remembers a time when he would lunch at the original Potbelly on Lincoln Ave, feasting on both a Wreck and a PB&amp;J.  Despite its proliferation, Potbelly still makes a great sandwich.  If you’re flying in or out of Midway, you can even enjoy one at the airport.

                                        Chris likes the falafel from Sultan’s Market so much he sometimes wears a t-shirt with their logo (this being a big deal since he rarely deigns to wear t-shirts not of his own design).  It’s also right down the street from Meredith’s old apartment – 2041 W. North Ave.

                                        When Meredith introduced the burgeoning drinkaholic to bubble tea as a novelty treat, she had no idea the addiction that would ensue.   Many an intern has been sent on a red-line sojourn for the coconut with red bean bubble tea.

The many layers of white, disposable plastic on the tables make for an authentic experience.  Plus going there requires you visit Chicago’s small but fun Chinatown.  And, it’s conveniently located right across from Joy Yee’s!

                                        Smoke Daddy’s has BBQ &amp; sweet potato fries appreciated by Meredith and “hot waitresses” appreciated by Chris (Meredith is surprised she doesn’t remember this important factor but defers to Chris).

                                        Chicago has a lot of great Mexican food, and <a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&amp;view=text&amp;hl=en&amp;q=tecalitlan&amp;near=Chicago,+IL&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;latlng=41896014,-87672519,16210473702703818699&amp;ei=YWE8SISeC4eujgH7hJiIAw&amp;cd=1'>Tecalitlan</a> is one of our favorites.  The tortilla chips are fresh and delicious, and the affordable margaritas by the pitcher assure a lively evening.   Check out the selection in the juke box.

                                        If you’ve caught Chris in the right mood, you’ve probably been on the receiving end of a diatribe re: the raw food cleanses that we’ve done.  Karyn’s is where that insanity first began (much like the aforementioned bubble tea, proposed by a naive, unknowing Meredith).  Meredith will allow Karyn’s mention, as it has played a relatively major role in our relationship.

                                        Despite many a Chicagoans protestation, Chicago is, in fact, a Midwestern city.  One of the major advantages of being such is the excellent steak available.  We don’t do a lot of steak eating, but if steak is up your alley, you should have some while you’re visiting.  Try Custom House for the full Chicago experience; bone-in filet is a specialty.

                                                The first is deep-dish pizza.  Ask any Chicagoan their favorite, and you’ll probably get a different but very stalwart answer.  Our favorite is <a href='http://loumalnatis.com'>Lou Malnati’s sausage</a>.  Be very hungry when you order this.

                                                While still living in Chicago, Meredith got a little obsessed with the thin crust pizza at <a href='http://www.piecechicago.com/'>Piece</a>, but if you want to join us for New Haven style pizza, let’s do that in …. New Haven!

                                                Chicago is also famous for hot dogs.  Most of our processed pork (or beef?) consumption took place at Wrigley Field.  Chris might even claim (and Meredith might even concede) that Meredith’s main motivation for attending a Cub’s game is justified hot dog intake.  A famous place for Chicago hot dogs is <a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;q=the+wieners+circle&amp;near=Chicago,+IL&amp;fb=1&amp;view=text&amp;latlng=16281100139065848082#'>the Wiener’s Circle</a>.  Chicago hot dogs do not come with ketchup, but they do come with pickles and a poppy seed bun.

                                        You, like Meredith, might be confused as to how Chris could both have had a job and still attended almost every game of the Cub’s season.  Meredith strongly recommends avoiding asking Chris about this unless you really, really enjoy talking about baseball.  Wrigley Field is classic, and if you look hard enough, you might even be able to find Chris’s personalized brick outside the stadium.

                                        If you’re hoping to take in an observation-deck view of the downtown and Lake Michigan, the Signature Room at the top of the Hancock Building is the place to do it.  Instead of paying to ride the elevator to the top of the Sears Tower (or the Hancock Building for that matter), put that money towards a snack or cocktail at the Signature Room.  It’s touristy, but there’s a reason this spot is popular.  The view from the lady’s room is one of the best.

                                        Chicago is rightfully renowned for its architecture.  Some of the best views of the buildings are from the water.  To that end, we suggest taking an architectural tour on the Chicago River.  In all likelihood Meredith’s former employer, the Leo Burnett Company, will be pointed out, as well the Chicago Mercantile Exchange where Chris was a member.

                                        Having grown up with allergies and a general distaste for animals, Meredith had not spent much time at the zoo.  In an attempt to appear laid-back and flexible (perhaps the first and only such attempt in their relationship), Meredith acquiesced to visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo on one of their early dates.  A good time was had by all.  Subsequently, Meredith has visited this Zoo while nannying upwards of 100 times, but Chris still knows many more animal names and noises.  The Lincoln Park Zoo is free and a great place to take kids.

                                        If you’re bringing your kids, another nanny-approved destination is the Notebart Nature Museum.   They have great hands-on displays and an amazing butterfly sanctuary where real butterflies may land on your head.

                                        The Chicago Botanic Gardens is the site of another of our early dates.  It was on this car trip to Glencoe that Meredith found out Chris is a musician and feared for her future spent in a wood-paneled basement “studio” pretending to enjoy “jam sessions.”  She was subsequently pleased to realize that she actually likes Chris’s music and that he and his brother actually operate a legitimate studio which is well-situated on a second floor.  None of this has anything to do with the gardens which are another good site for kids and should be beautiful in October.

                                        The Ba’hai temple et environs was the site of Chris &amp; Meredith’s first real date.  The Ba’hideout, as Chris calls the enclave of Lake Michigan just beyond the temple, turned out to be auspicious for us.  The temple itself is gorgeous.  Meredith believed for a few minutes that the Ba’hai temple can be seen from space until she remembered that that is the Taj Mahal.

                                        Weather willing, a walk along Chicago’s lakepath is always a great way to enjoy the city.

                                        Per our friends Catrin &amp; Ben, Millennium Park is perhaps the finest example of why people love and hate Chicago Mayor Richard Daley.  This monument to the inevitability of cost-overuns in city government set back taxpayers over $500 million.  But it sure is nice.  Check out the spitting faces (you have to watch them for long enough) and the sculpture in the picture, officially called Cloud Gate, but known as the Bean.

                                        Chicago has a number of great museums to enjoy.  Chris prefers the classic <a href='http://artic.edu' class='inlinelink'>Art Institute</a>. While Meredith can’t deny the greatness of the Art Institute, she likes the <a href='http://mcachicago.org' class='inlinelink'>MCA</a> better and was pleased to discover the special exhibition going on October 17 &amp; 18 is entitled  <a href='http://mcachicago.org/exhibitions/exh_detail.php?id=200' class='inlinelink'>“Everything's Here: Jeff Koons and His Experience of Chicago.”</a> The <a href='http://msichicago.org' class='inlinelink'>Museum of Science and Industry</a> is also great.
