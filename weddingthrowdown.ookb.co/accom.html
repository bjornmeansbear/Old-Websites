                	<h1>Travelling to and Staying in Chicago</h1>
                    <h2>Chicago Airports</h2>
                    <p>
						Chicago has two major airports:  O’Hare (ORD) and Midway (MDW).  The truth is, flying into Chicago is a pick-your-poison sort of situation.  O’Hare is infamous for flight delays (Chicagoans like to blame the weather rather than the infrastructure) while Midway was once accurately described by an out-of-town friend as, “Disneyland without the rides”  (long lines, hoards of families, and miserable kids).  The upside of Chicago’s airports is that they are both linked to the city by public transportation.  O’Hare is on the blue line and is approximately a 40 minute ride to downtown while the ride from Midway to downtown on the orange line should take about 35 minutes. <a href='http://www.ohare.com/'>www.ohare.com</a> or <a href='http://www.chicago-mdw.com/'>midway</a> information.

					<h2>Where to Stay</h2>
                    <p>
                        Annoyingly yet fittingly, the weekend we chose for our parties is also the weekend of an optometrist convention in Chicago.  Thus, both hotel rooms and bargain rates are scarce.  We recommend booking your rooms in advance (West family, this means you).  We’ve reserved some rooms just so hotels don’t get sold out, but we’d also recommend trying to find better rates on <a href='http://tickets.priceline.com/default.asp?rdr=1&amp;session_key=400011AC410011AC20080527194114612931088068'>www.priceline.com</a>

					<p>
                    	We’ve reserved both king and double rooms here for $259/night.  This rate is guaranteed until July 1, 2008.  Say you are with the Abraham PARTY.  As with all things wedding, rates are automatically higher if the word is even uttered, so we have booked rooms for a PARTY not a wedding.  You can walk to all downtown sites from here, and Tru is 0.6 miles away.

						Another option is Vacation Rentals by Owner.  A good friend of ours highly recommends this site.  You can get one bedroom apartments all the way up to big places that sleep double digits.  This option could be fun and affordable.<br />
