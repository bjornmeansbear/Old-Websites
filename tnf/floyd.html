Why this is the case is still unclear to most everyone.     Floyd cannot die but can unfortunately feel pain. This is perhaps why Satan     has chosen Floyd as the target of his two dimensional robot of destruction     Tor, for the sheer pleasure of watching someone indefinitely suffer... whatever,     anyway, Floyd is our unfortunate hero, and he and his friends are always on     the look out for Tor, Robo-Floyd and any other of Satan's minions</font></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><a href="character.html">BACK TO     CHARACTERS</a></font></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
