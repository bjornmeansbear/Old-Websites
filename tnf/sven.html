Usually it     means that he is hangin' out being a fool, and having Pork call his pager     from the phone in the school pretending to be girls, as well as hitting on     some of the teachers. He has been band from all school events and places,     but somehow manages to get in anyway. Other than that, he just kinda follows     around Floyd and drinks cokes with a twist at Ghetto Stan's...</font></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><a href="character.html">BACK TO     CHARACTERS</a></font></p></div></body></html>
