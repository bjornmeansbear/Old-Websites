It works on several levels. First, it utilizes an old variant of a DuPont advertising slogan from the 30’s (that lasted until 1982)—”Better Things for Better Living... Through Chemistry.” The phrase also changes the way sustainability is perceived. No longer does sustainability sound like a sacrifice. This statement should make it apparent that sustainability can better everyone’s lives! I believe in technology, I believe in American innovation, and so does this slogan.                        </p>                        <p>                            My aim is to use this slogan as a starting point for a myriad of other ventures, writings, branding strategies, installations, etc. and push this message onto people any way that I can.                        </p>                 	</div>                    <!--                    <div id='hiding'>                        <div class='gore hide'>                        	<p>                            	Upon watching Al's TED conference talk, I got to thinking, who else better to tell you are working on this than al gore?
