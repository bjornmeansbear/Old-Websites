I must say that making this       page has been a big relief for me. I guess it's just one of those things       that kills you to keep to yourself for ever. I've know for a number of years       now, in highschool I really wasn't sure, but after being at K for two years       I feel that I can no longer deny myself and my friends of who I really am.       It's not an easy decision to come to, I thought that it would really be       much easier than it is, hence the web page. </span></font></p>    <p class="flamink"><font face="Swing, Capitals"> This page besides announching       my coming to terms with life and who I am. Will from this point forward       serve as an outlet for the things I feel and how I am coping with them.       I hope that someone out there in cyberspace is wandering across this and       it helps them to make the same kind of decisions and provids anwers to the       questions we don't feel comfortable asking others, especially our parents!       To naviagate around the site search out the buttons on the top and left.       </font></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p class="flamink">&nbsp;</p>  </blockquote></div></body></html>
