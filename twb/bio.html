Or what is The Winter Blanket ... We can't really say they have a home; it depends on who you ask. 			From snowy Minneapolis, Minnesota or small-town Illinois ... Someone is sure they are from Fairbanks, Alaska ... quite a drive. 			Speaking of driving, they have been just about everywhere and perhaps everywhere is their home. Waking up in the back seat of a 			touring van in Coeur d' Alene, Idaho. Looking out the window, a mountain blizzard. Checking the clock, three in the morning. 			I think I saw them picking sand from their teeth and ears on the South Jersey ocean beach.<br /><br />			Certainly they are somewhere out there, chasing songs that chase the golden sun. What are the songs? Simple. Familiar. Imagine 			Townes Van Zandt and Gillian Welch playing with Crazy Horse.<br /><br />			Indeed their never-ending journey has left a paper trail in the form of three full-length records. Early releases Hopeless 			Lullaby and Actors and Actresses were recorded in Duluth, Minnesota looking out on Lake Superior. Whereas Hopeless Lullaby 			was a shy introduction, Actors and Actresses captured a clash between a young band learning to play and write, against a 			demand to apprehend a runaway concept album.<br /><br />			From there, the band hit the road with Low and Richard Buckner, and continued to play and write for a period of two years. 			That culmination is evident in their most recent release Prescription Perils. The relative simplicity of the music defies 			the fact that the band took two years to create the songs. But they wanted it that way, perhaps as a reaction to the complexity 			of their previous release.<br /><br />			Prescription Perils is the band's most accomplished record to date. The album captures the full range of their sound from 			electric guitar-driven classic rock to spare acoustic guitar arrangements with hints of cello and banjo. The record stands			 as the best showcase of the band's special ability to alternate between male and female vocal perspectives. Graceful drumming 			 and inventive bass playing solidify the sound.<br /><br />			The band hit the road in support of Prescription Perils, and along the way met up with Magnolia Electric Co., another classic-rock 			kindred spirit. Like The Winter Blanket, they too are intent on reviving the classic-rock sound of Neil Young, Springteen and 			Creedence amongst others. After all, isn't that music the soundtrack to life on the road? I'm sure it is for these blue-collar 			kids from the Midwest.<br /><br />			Now for their fourth record, The Winter Blanket has teamed up with famed producer Brian Deck at Engine Studios in Chicago. 			The record, Golden Sun, is due out in spring '06 on Chapel Hill-based Fractured Discs, which also released Prescription Perils 			and is now giving the band's music a reliable home.<br /><br />			Meanwhile, look for the band out there on the road somewhere. As a two, three, four or five piece--their presentation defies 			expectations while never divorcing from an identifiable sound. And keeping it interesting is fuel to burn for the road ahead.<br /><br />			The Winter Blanket is:<br />			Dave Campbell--bass and keys<br />			Stephanie Davila--vocals, guitar, lap steel, piano<br />			Todd Hansen--drums and percussion<br />			Doug Miller--vocals, guitar, harmonica, piano<br /><br />			</p>		</div></div></body></html>
