Visit the MP3 link.</p>				<p class='date'>7/26/06</p>				<h2>Record News! Release Dates</h2>				<p class='entry'>				Friends! Massive amounts of planning are happening right now and there have been some big changes to take note of. 				We'll drop a numbered list here and get all organized.<br />				1. Doug is growing his hair out. There are concerns about heat and his job that surround this decision. We'll keep you posted. 				Perhaps a rat-tail would be better or faux-bangs? Your thoughts? Weigh in.<br />				2. The new record, Golden Sun, will be an EP and not a full length. Many may be asking "why?". Answer: We took the cream of 				the crop, no filler and put it on the EP. We're going through a lot of changes right now, creatively, so we thought it best 				to do it this way and get back into the studio ASAP to record more with the new line-up. That said, we apologize for to 				those who were anticipating 10 songs...but we promise you we'll deliver the goods, 10 strong, very soon.<br />				3. That said, the national release date is October 31, with shows and such to follow! Get excited. We are.<br />				4. Dave had his jaw drilled into yesterday. He has pain killers now. He's a happy man.<br />				Look for more updates soon as we get the publicity machine runnin'. Exciting times lay ahead. Chicago, Madison, Lawrence, 				Iowa City, watch your back. We're heading your way soon. Believe it.<br /><br />				Beat the heat,<br />				The WB				</p>								<p class='date'>5/23/06</p>				<h2>"Golden Sun" Artwork!</h2>				<p class='entry'>				The cover artwork for "Golden Sun" will feature a beautiful photo by Nyree Watts.
