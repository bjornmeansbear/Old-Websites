          <h2>The Groom</h2>
          <p>Sean Luft McCaffrey was born and raised in Evanston, IL. He competed in a variety of sports growing up, but ended up settling on swimming. Sean joined the Evanston Township High School Swimming Team which he participated in all of high school, and it was swimming that helped him decide to attend the University of Minnesota, where he also swam for four years gaining NCAA All-American honors. After graduating Sean took up coaching and became the head coach of the Minnetonka Swim Club. After three years of coaching, Sean made a career change and began working for Target Corporation in Store Management.</p>

He enjoys swimming for exercise, reading the occasional nerd book, rocking out on the drums in Rock Band, and grilling ribs on his Weber. He remains an avid Chicago sports fan and watches as many games as possible without upsetting his bride to be.</p>

          <h2>The Couple</h2>
          <p>Sean and Lisa met while eating lunch at the Pioneer Hall cafeteria at the University of Minnesota. After Sean mustered up the courage to ask Lisa out they dated on and off for eight years. Sean proposed to Lisa over Memorial Day weekend 2010 as they were about to walk out the door to dinner with both of their parents. The parents were a little puzzled why they were late to dinner but after they heard the news they were thrilled.</p>
          <p>As a couple, Sean and Lisa enjoy cooking together, traveling and spending time together. They love hosting dinner and Rock Band parties for friends and family. In the summer, they also travel to Lisa’s family’s cabin in Northern Minnesota for fishing and relaxation. Both Lisa and Sean are looking forward to starting a new life together and are hoping to get a dog in the not so distant future.</p>
