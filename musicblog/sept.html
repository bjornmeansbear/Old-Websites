Mark Kozelek plays 					the lead singer from &#8220;Hot Tears&#8221; in the movie, but they really are playing the songs 					from Ghosts from the Great Highway. I love Mark Kozelek, and seeing him in a movie, hearing the songs, it got me 					back on those albums. I believe that he is on a little tour starting soon, and you should get out and see 					him if you can. I have heard that he does not like to ride in cars, and so does not go on tour very 					often for that reason. Thus you cannot miss the chance to get out and see him. Cannot!					<br /><br />					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='a/electropura.jpg' alt='yo la tengo - electropura album cover' />					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='a/notafraid.jpg' alt='yo la tengo - beat your ass album cover' />					This is an album that I cannot believe is over a decade old already. Amazing. It still sounds current, still sounds 					exciting, still sounds like it has urgency and meaning, still sounds just plain good. This album has been showing 					up quite often in my itunes shuffle rotation. It is something that I never could quite place just hearing 					it in the background. However, once it finally came to me that all these songs I was hearing were on one 					album, and that it was a yo la tengo album, i got a little hooked. Starting with Decora (which Spoon covers 					on a compilation album by the Believer Magazine of favorite indie covers by other indies) you know you are 					off to a good start. The album as a whole has a nice combination of noise and melody and excitement and energy 					and just the perfect hint of quiteness to bring it down a notch in just the right places. 					&#8220;Tom Courtenay,&#8221; track 4, is one of my favorite songs on the album. The opening has the correct amount of 					memorable melody and memorable lyrics - &#8220;Hilary Christie, the rumors are true...&#8221; great opening lines. 					The songs placement in the order makes the Tom Coutenay suddenly rock pretty hard. 					As a whole there is a nice flow from song to song, a general cohesive feel to all the songs 					without them all simply sounding the same. I love that in an album. There are some sonic refernces to the Velvet 					Underground in the types and durations of distorted song endings, particularly the song &#8220;Attack on Love,&#8221; a sort 					of sonic battle which sounds as though it could have come of of the Velvet underground and Nico. 					Yo La Tengo has just released a new record called &#8220;I am not afraid of you and i will beat your ass,&#8221; wow! 					The new album shows  remarkable growth over the last decade. Now there are several albums in between, 					but just listening to the two in a row shows that it is still the same band, but that they have a new 					matured sound that has lost the angst but gained a wry wit that shows in smart piano parts and milder 					distorted guitars, flutterly falseto vocal lines and lovely, snappy drum parts.					<br /><br />					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='a/ca_country.jpg' alt='Camera Obscura - Lets get out of this country album cover' />					Camera Obscura are fans of Mo-Town music. This may not be a for sure fact, but it is what i take away from 					listening to their music. Particularly on &#8220;Let's Get Out of This Country,&#8221; they sound as if they 					have channeled Phil Spector and his vintage reverb into their recording. The drum beats are there too, the few 					standard mo-town beats fill a songs like &#8220;Lloyd, I&#8217;m ready to be Heartbroken,&#8221; &#8220;Come 					Back Margaret,&#8221; and &#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of this Country.&#8221; They have the feel of a more nostalgic 					to Belle and Sebastian, nicely orchestrated with female vocals that sit firmly on top of the music. They fall into 					the sonic realm that i really enjoy to just listen to over and over again. At first the music is enjoyable enough 					on its own to read or eat or cook or design websites too, but as you continue to listen you start to hear the 					nuances in the lyrics, and pick up on the extra sounds and harmonies floating amongst the rest of the mix. Another 					album that might not blow you away like Funeral or Oh! inverted World, but that will be enjoyable for many 					listens to come					<br /><br />					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='a/drives.jpg' alt='Duplomacy - Long Drives album cover' />					I have had the pleasure to know this band for some time now. While at my lowly 2024 records intern position these 					guys were signed to the label. I have probably seen them play live about fifty times now, and each time they are just 					as grateful that everyone has come out to see them. I do not think the realization that the twin cities really 					enjoys them has sunk in yet. This is their first proper full-length as a band. The original album that got them all 					their hype and shows was simply an EP that band leader Andy Flynn recorded with T.W.Walsh (of Pedro the lion 					album production fame). It was simple and slow and beautiful. The full band effort reinvisions some of the EP's songs					with the &#8220;full band feel.&#8221; The guitar parts lazily mingle with one another, the drums 					trudge evenly along, and the vocals float beautifully above it all. There is no rushed feeling to any of the numbers, 					they all keep an even pace, moving from one song to the next, marching steadily from beginning to end. 					My favorite duplomacy song is still Coppertone, which has been given new life					since the EP. I just love the lyric &#8220;Maybe we should call it off, leave what's bad enough alone /					such a sunny attitude, without a drop of coppertone.&#8221; The other aspect of Dupe's songs that always catches 					me is the transitions. There is a big build up in some of the songs that takes you by surprise. Suddenly a wall of 					distortion blows into the mix, or the tempo suddenly changes, or perhaps the song takes a complete twist. That is 					the beauty of the album, the song structures may be simple, but Duplomacy is not afraid to change it up unexpectedly 					to give you something new and original from some well-trodden territory.					<br /><br />					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='a/wolf.jpg' alt='Wolfmother album cover' />					Do you like Black Sabbath or Led Zepplin or maybe AC/DC if so than go and buy this right now. i mean it, right now. 					There is absolutely nothing original about this album, nothing, all of their chops and tricks have been directly 					taken from the hard rock pantheon of great bands. The only thing is that they haven't been done in a while, and 					maybe what everyone needs right now is this decades Masters of Reality. The fact remains that while this album 					may not be original it is fun to listen to at least. And for all you kids out there who's parents did not own 					any Sabbath or Zepplin perhaps this will do for you, and maybe even sound engagingly fresh. The song &#8220;Woman&#8221; 					is the stand out track for me on this record, it is plain and simple and rocks. And that is what this album is all 					about, 3 kids from australia playing hard rock simply and plainly. Fun but nothing fancy, brainless enjoyment 					for the masses who missed out on early ozzy. Oh, the album artwork is totally awesome however. Cliche in the same 					way as the music, but awesome none the less.					<br /><br />					If you are wondering about the lack of new music, and lack of stuff heard it is becuase I 					have been listening to a lot of NPR lately - and trying to learn - or at least have been trying 					to learn how to be pretentious... 					It is interesting to me that the feeling I get from knowing the most current world affairs is not 					one of elation or happiness, or even wisdom but more likely takes the form of despair and frustration. 					Actually listening to an entire Bush press conference is much 					more maddening than just hearing the dumbest four soundbites on local news. And hearing correspondants from 					foreign lands that actually know what they are talking about, and do not just tell us what the bushites want 					us all to hear about how afghanistan or iraq or lebanon or djibuti are going. crazy. i am getting a little flustered 					even typing this. man.					<br /><br />					back to music.					<br /><br />					Has anyone listened the new Thom Yorke album? how about the Heartless Bastards? anyone tired of music? 					anyone have their own top ten list? Get in <a href='mailto:soundmachinedream@mac.com'>touch</a> 					if any of these are so.					<br /><br />					Peace in the middle east					<br /><br />					Kristian					<br /><br />					<em>p.s. before i posted all of this nonsense, i made a stop at Best Buy to check out receivers... I am putting 					together a new stereo, and before i ordered online i just wanted to make sure in person that the sony i was looking at 					had everything i wanted. Well i checked out the stereo, and then before i knew it i had bought five new albums and 					season four of seinfeld... so there are some additions to albums acquired, though they weren't meaningfully listened 					to yet. Oh and it you have not seen it already, you really need to go online and check out the treadmill video by					OK GO (it will either be undera google search for 'treadmill video' or 'here it goes again video') it is amazing, that is all i 					have to say on the matter - oh and they filmed it themselves... Sadly, as i went to put away the new 					ben kweller disc, i was not able to locate his earlier album that i had imagined owning - sha sha - it 					is a darn shame, just disappeared.</em>				</p>			</div>			<div id='sidebar'>				<div id='acquired'>					<h2>Albums Acquired</h2>					<ul>						<li>Band of Horses * <span class='album'>Everything All The Time</span></li>						<li>the Beatles * <span class='album'>Abbey Road</span></li>						<li>the Beatles * <span class='album'>#1</span></li>						<li>Camera Obscura * <span class='album'>Let's Get Out of This Country</span></li>						<li>Camera Obscura * <span class='album'>Under Achievers Please Try Harder</span></li>						<li>Duplomacy * <span class='album'>All These Long Drives</span></li>						<li>Elefant * <span class='album'>The Black Magic Show</span></li>						<li>Ben Kweller * <span class='album'>Ben Kweller</span></li>						<li>Of Montreal * <span class='album'>The Sunlandic Twins</span></li>						<li>OK GO * <span class='album'>Oh No</span></li>						<li>Wolfmother * <span class='album'>Wolfmother</span></li>					</ul>					</div>				<div id='heard'>					<h2>Albums Heard</h2>					<ul>						<li>Duplomacy * <span class='album'>All These Long Drives</span></li>						<li>Haley Bonar * <span class='album'>Lure The Fox</span></li>						<li>Thunder In The Valley * <span class='album'>A Long, Long Walk</span></li>						<li>Wolfmother * <span class='album'>Wolfmother</span></li>						<li>Yo La Tengo * <span class='album'>Electr-O-Pura</span></li>						<li>Yo La Tengo * <span class='album'>I am not afraid and I will beat your ass</span></li>					</ul>				</div>				<div id='bands'>					<h2>Bands, Etc.</h2>					<ul>						<li><a href='http://www.kiddakota.com'>Kid Dakota</a></li>						<li><a href='http://www.viciousvicious.com'>Vicious Vicious</a></li>						<li><a href='http://www.duplomacy.com'>Duplomacy</a></li>						<li><a href='http://www.2024records.com'>2024 Records</a></li>						<li><a href='http://www.chriskoza.com'>Chris Koza</a></li>						<li><a href='http://www.ironandwine.com'>Iron and Wine</a></li>						<li><a href='http://www.blanketmusic.com'>the Winter Blanket</a></li>						<li><a href='http://www.newchicagosound.com'>New Chicago Sound</a></li>						<li><a href='http://www.gorillavsbear.blogspot.com'>Gorilla Vs.
