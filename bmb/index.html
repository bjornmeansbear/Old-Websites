The same amount of work is not going into recording and playing however, 				and I am hoping to remedy that in the near future. All that I can say for now is that if you want to hear my stuff, give me a call 				and perhaps we can schedule a private performance or something. Maybe your friend's band is having a show and you need an opening 				act? networking - that is what I am talking about.<br />				<br />				Its all happening<br />				<br />				K				</p>			</div>			<div id='decoration' class='right'>				<div id='pict'><div id='pict_corners'></div></div>				<div><a href='http://www.itempimoderni.com'><img id='decorative' src='img/sitedesign.gif' alt='itempimoderni designed this page, here is their link'/></a></div>			</div>		</div><!-- Site content above here -->	</div>
