Neil Young? Neil Halstead? Matt Pond PA? Well				Kristian Bjornard has, and he has been shamelessly ripping them off&mdash;paying homage rather&mdash;for years.				<br /><br />				Kristian was born in the eighties, grew up in the suburbs, went to a small private college, and then 				wrote some songs about it. Once upon a time he was known as the singer in a chicago band named Halfwaynorth, 				Kristian has since moved back to his (nearly) native minneapolis to bring his melancholic melodies of suburban				sex and cellular phones to a club near you.				<br /><br />				Normally appearing as a solo act of Kristian and guitar and perhaps a laptop sequencing array, there are others				that occasionally lend their talents.				Jason Abraham, a former bandmate in Halfwaynorth, who plays some guitars and aids in all control room related issues.  				Rachel Sarto (formerly of minneapolis act super happy fun machine) brings cello chops to the studio and stage. 				</p>			</div>			<div id='decoration' class='right'>				<div id='pict'><div id='pict_corners'></div></div>				<div><a href='http://www.itempimoderni.com'><img id='decorative' src='img/sitedesign.gif' alt='itempimoderni designed this page, here is their link'/></a></div>			</div>		</div><!-- Site content above here -->	</div></body></html>
