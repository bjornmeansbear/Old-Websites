							<h2>About</h2>
							<p>
								Idle Hands Baking Company was launched in the summer of 2008 by Owner and Head Baker, Ra‑
								chael Devlin. A lifelong hobby baker, she entered the vegan baking world in 2006 creating organic
								vegan treats and hasn’t looked back since.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our vision is to create delicious and decadent treats that you’ll never know is vegan until someone
								tells you.We’re a 100% vegan bakery, and our treats are made on dedicated vegan equipment.
								Whether you’re choosing a vegan treat for your health, for your beliefs, or just for something differ‑
								ent, we believe that we shouldn’t let the omnivores have all the fun.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our creations are rich, delicious and playful, and you surely won’t miss the dairy... we promise.
								We’ve been surprising our friends, our family, and our clients for years!
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe in using only the finest organic and sustainably raised ingredients, and try to source them
								as locally as possible. We not only strive to make a product that is better for you and better for the
								planet, but better tasting too!
